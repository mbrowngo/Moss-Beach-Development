The client had completed graphics and no experience with the web. The challenge was to create a site for her that was visually appealing using her own identity, but which was possible for her to maintain without help.</p><p>The solution was to build the site in PHP with a MySQL database which I designed. All the content on the site is dynamically generated with no content native in the templates what so ever. The images are all randomly picked for page headers and decoration. The images specific to each entry is stored in the file system with a pointer in the database. I tied in Easy PHP Calendar which allows the client to administer their own information. The blogging system is rudimentary and of my own design. It is not intended to allow tracking or customer feedback per the customer's requirement.</p><p>Two exposed levels of navigation when the user is in the teachers section.</p><p>On the back end, the administration for the site was built with Adobe Spry widgets (which I would not use again) and DataAssist from WebAssist which creates a set of insert, update, delete forms. In the insert and edit forms, I implemented CKEditor and CKfinder to allow visual editing of the entries in the database.</p> <ul><li>MySQL PHP site with no content in templates.</li><li>Third party controls CKEditor, CKFinder and Easy PHP Calendar</li><li>Administration site for customer for self administration</li><li>Designed visual layout and interaction models</li><li>Mobile dynamic PHP site for Android and iOS built with jQueryMobile</li></ul>";
